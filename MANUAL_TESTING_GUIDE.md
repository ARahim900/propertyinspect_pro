# Manual Testing Guide for PropertyInspect Pro

## 🎯 Overview
Since Flutter/Dart CLI tools are not available in the current environment, this guide provides manual steps to test and verify the implementation.

## 📋 Pre-Testing Checklist

### 1. **Install Flutter Dependencies**
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

If you encounter any dependency conflicts, run:
```bash
flutter pub deps
flutter pub upgrade
```

### 2. **Verify Flutter Installation**
```bash
flutter doctor
flutter --version
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### **Step 1: Basic App Launch**
```bash
# Test debug build
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=env.json

# If the above fails, try without env file first
flutter run
```

**Expected Result**: App should launch without crashes, showing the login screen.

### **Step 2: Test Error Handling**
1. **Launch the app**
2. **Navigate to Debug screen** (visible in debug mode)
3. **Click "Test Database Connection"**
4. **Check console output** for error handling logs

**Expected Result**: 
- ✅ Errors should be caught gracefully
- ✅ Console should show detailed error logs
- ✅ App should not crash

### **Step 3: Test Input Validation**
1. **Go to Login screen**
2. **Try invalid inputs**:
   - Empty email field
   - Invalid email format (e.g., "test")
   - Empty password
   - Short password (less than 6 characters)

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Validation errors should appear in real-time
- ✅ Form should not submit with invalid data
- ✅ Error messages should be user-friendly

### **Step 4: Test Offline Functionality**
1. **Launch the app**
2. **Disable internet connection**
3. **Try to perform actions** (login, navigation)
4. **Re-enable internet**

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ App should detect offline status
- ✅ Offline data should be stored locally
- ✅ Data should sync when back online

### **Step 5: Test Performance Monitoring**
1. **Launch the app**
2. **Navigate between screens**
3. **Check Debug screen** for performance metrics
4. **Look at console output** for timing logs

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ Performance metrics should be tracked
- ✅ Console should show operation timings
- ✅ No memory leaks or performance warnings

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Firebase Not Configured**
**Symptoms**: Firebase initialization errors
**Solution**: 
1. Create Firebase project
2. Add your app to Firebase
3. Download config files
4. Update `lib/firebase_options.dart`

### **Issue 2: Dependency Conflicts**
**Symptoms**: Pub get fails with version conflicts
**Solution**:
```bash
flutter pub deps
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
```

### **Issue 3: Import Errors**
**Symptoms**: "Package not found" errors
**Solution**: Check that all imports use correct paths:
- Services: `import '../../services/service_name.dart';`
- Utils: `import '../../utils/util_name.dart';`
- Mixins: `import '../../mixins/mixin_name.dart';`

### **Issue 4: Build Errors**
**Symptoms**: Compilation fails
**Solution**:
1. Run `flutter clean`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Check for syntax errors in modified files

## 📊 Success Criteria

### **Minimum Viable Implementation**
- ✅ App launches without crashes
- ✅ Basic error handling works
- ✅ Input validation functions
- ✅ Database connection established

### **Full Implementation**
- ✅ All services initialized successfully
